# Optimal-Checkpointing-Strategies-for-Iterative-Applications
This work provides an optimal checkpointing strategy to protect iterative applications from fail-stop errors.
We consider a very general framework, where the application repeats the same execution pattern by executing consecutive iterations, and where each iteration is composed of several tasks.
These tasks have different execution lengths and different checkpoint costs.  
Both the naive and Young/Daly strategies are suboptimal.
Our main contribution is to show that the optimal checkpoint strategy is globally periodic, and to design a dynamic programming algorithm that computes the optimal checkpointing pattern. This pattern may well checkpoint many different tasks, and this across many different iterations. We show through simulations, both from synthetic and real-life application scenarios, that the optimal strategy significantly outperforms the naive and Young/Daly strategies.
